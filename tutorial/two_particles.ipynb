Suppose for all pair of particles, contact parameters are same.\n",

    "  * pair of particles in $S_2$ have contact properties $C_{22}$\n",
    "  * remaining pair of particles have contact properties $C_{12}$\n",
    "- **Case 3.** Start from scratch and suppose now first $r$ particles, in set $\\bar{S}_1 = \\{1, 2, ..., r\\}$, are of circular shape, and remaining particles, in set $\\bar{S}_2 = \\{r+1, r+2, ..., N\\}$, are hexagon shaped. Also suppose all particles have same material properties and same contact propertis.\n",
    "- **Case 4.** Let **case 3** holds. We now ask that some particles of set $\\bar{S}_1$ have material properties $\\bar{M}_{11}$ and some have material properties $\\bar{M}_{12}$. Similarly, we ask that some subset of $\\bar{S}_2$ have material properties $\\bar{M}_{21}$ and remaining have $\\bar{M}_{22}$\n",

    "- **Case 6.** Start from scract, and assume that all particles are of same shape, same material properties, contact is same for any pair of particles. But now we assume that first $s$ particles, in set $\\tilde{S}_1 = \\{1, 2, ..., s\\}$, are assigned a fine mesh, and remaining, in set $\\tilde{S}_2 = \\{s+1, s+2, ..., N\\}$, are assigned a coarse mesh. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for outlining some of the possibility above is to show that in a multi-particle system, we often have to deal of subgroup specified properties. When properties change from one subset to another, it automatically generates a subgrouping. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Case 1\n",
    "Consider **case 1**. Here it is natural to create two zones (with zone we mean the subgroup); we will assign all particles in set $S_1$ the zone id $1$ and remaining particles zone id $2$. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Contact defined for pair of zones\n",
    "- Initial condition and boundary conditions (force or displacement) can either be applied by listing **global id** (i.e. 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1) or **zone id**. In the latter case, the conditions are applied to all particles in the specified **zone**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remark 1.** Reference particle is such that all particles are related by affine transformation of reference particle. You can think of finite element method where shape functions and their derivatives over any arbitrary element is computed using the map taking reference element to the arbitrary element. This reference element of course has a same shape as the arbitrary element.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **case 1**, input file will have two zones and the properties as said above will be zone specific. Contact properties will be specified for the pair of zones, i.e., *<zone 1, zone 1>*, *<zone 2, zone 2>*, *<zone 1, zone 2>*. Note that contact properties are same for *<zone 1, zone 2>* and *<zone 2, zone 1>*. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remark 2.** When there is only one group (in situation when particles are of same shape, same material, same contact properties, and are obtained from same mesh of a reference particle), we will have just one **zone** in the simulation and all particles will belong to this zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Case 2\n",
    "In this case, having just two zones (repeating that **zone** simply means subgroup) is enough as the contact in our simulation is always assigned for a pair of zones. So we can have the same input file as in **case 1** and simply modify the contact block of the input file where we can have properties $C_{11}, C_{22}, C_{12}$ for *<zone 1, zone 1>*, *<zone 2, zone 2>*, and *<zone 1, zone 2>* pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Case 3\n",
    "In this case, since the shape of particles differ and one group of particles defined by set $\\bar{S}_1$ are of circular shape and remainig particles are of hexagon shape, it makes sense to again create two **zones**:\n",
    "- add particles in set $\\bar{S}_1$ to **zone 1**\n",
    "- add remaining particles to **zone 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then specify the properties, as before, in a `zone-specific` fashion. We provide the details of reference particle (i.e., circle) and associated mesh in **zone 1** area of input file and do same of hexagon reference particle and associated mesh in **zone 2** area of input file. \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we will define material properties for all particles in zone 1 and zone 2 and define the contact properties using pair of zones. We can have different material properties for particles in zone 1 and zone 2 and similary have different contact properties for different pair of two zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Case 4\n",
    "In this case, having just two zones is not enough. If we look at **case 3**, we see that **case 4** further subdivides the **case 3** in the basis of material properties. We need **four zones** to handle this case:\n",
    "- **zone 1.** circle shaped particles with material properties $\\bar{M}_{11}$\n",
    "- **zone 2.** circle shaped particles with material properties $\\bar{M}_{12}$\n",
    "- **zone 3.** hexagon shaped particles with material properties $\\bar{M}_{21}$\n",
    "- **zone 4.** hexagon shaped particles with material properties $\\bar{M}_{22}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define the material properties, reference particle geometry and mesh in a `zone-specific` fashion and define the contact properties for pair of zones. In this case we have to specify 10 contact properties as there are 10 unique pairs of zones (we take *<i,j>* pair same as *<j,i>* for the purpose of contact).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.5 Case 5\n",
    "In our implementation, both particle and wall inherit from a base particle implementation, see [BaseParticle](https://github.com/prashjha/PeriDEM/blob/main/src/particle/baseParticle.h), however, conceptually both are treated differently. One of the major difference is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Particle have associated reference particle so that they can be obtained by affine transformation of reference particle. However, for walls we do not assume or require to have reference particle. In the simulation, one has to describe all geometric details and mesh file for each wall seperately.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wall always belong to a different and unique zone. If we have n walls, we will atleast have n zones. If we have n walls and N particles, in the simplest case, we will have n+1 zone where n zones will correspond to n walls, and remaining zone will correspond to all the N particles. If particles are required to be grouped in smaller groups, say 4 groups, we will have n+4 zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that walls are assigned unique zones such that only one wall can be in one zone, and since the properties are specified in a `zone-specific` fashion, it is easy to specify properties of walls and group of particles in different zones. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the specific example in **case 5**, we will have 3 zones:\n",
    "- **zone 1.** For the wall\n",
    "- **zone 2.** For particles in set $S_1$ (see description of **case 1**)\n",
    "- **zone 3.** For remaining particles.\n",
    "We then have properties such as mesh, reference particle (only for zone 2 and 3), material properties for each zone, and have contact properties for pair of zones (in this case we need to assign contact properties for 6 unique pair of zones). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.6 Case 6\n",
    "This example shows why concept of zone is handy. In this case, all particles are identical except their meshes. In this case it is natural to have two zones:\n",
    "- **zone 1.** For particles with fine mesh\n",
    "- **zone 2.** For particles with coarse mesh."
